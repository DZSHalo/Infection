Current issue with re-port Infection:

Things left to do.
* Player scoreboard patch (cannot provide sig of these patches due to halo build are not compatible.)
* Implement uninitialize support to revert back to original gameplay.
** (DONE) there's a patch to tag meta, relative to must_be_readied and must_be_picked_up.
** What else?
* Implement storage for player leaving on current gameplay, not previous or next one.
* On EXTOnLoad hook, need to passdown map's name to EXTOnMapLoad hook function.

Finally
* Implement suppport for commands
** Including enable/disable gametype.
* Check if game is hoster.
* Option for game_enable (to permit override, require command implement first.)

Extra Feature
* Check gametype name containing Infection (case insensitive)
** If so, then enable gametype. Although, need 2 implement. 1 global enable and 1 gametype enable.
* Strip down to separate existing hooks to remove necessary timer event.
==================================

cur_players = pIHaloEngine->serverHeader->totalPlayers

Persistent = continuing aka does not unload at end of game.

* Funcs (DONE)
* Timers (DONE)
* Hooks (DONE)


============

Relative, yet new idea.

Have a default section, then... use map name section for specific global values.



30 ticks = 1 second (Or is it 33 ticks = 1 second? Seems like it is...)
100 ms = ?
1 tick = 0.0333333 second

How to calcuate ticks...
30 ticks * xxx second(s) = total of ticks.
